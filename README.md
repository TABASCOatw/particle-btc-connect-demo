    Particle Network BTC Connect (Secondary) Demo
  </h3>
</div>

‚ö°Ô∏è Demo application showcasing the implementation of Particle Network's BTC Connect SDK, enabling the utilization of an EVM-based ERC-4337 smart account alongside a Bitcoin native wallet through the same interface (UniSat, OKX, Xverse). BTC Connect leverages signatures generated by Bitcoin wallets to authenticate transactions within smart accounts, therefore enabling a new level of unified interaction between Bitcoin and various Bitcoin Layer-2's.

Built using **BTC Connect (by Particle Network)**, **TypeScript**

## ‚Çø BTC Connect
BTC Connect takes advantage of ERC-4337 alongside (Bitcoin) Layer-2 EVM-compatible blockchains to leverage a Smart Account, Paymaster, Bundler natively within Bitcoin wallets (connected to through a Bitcoin-specific modal also provided by BTC Connect). As its core, BTC Connect enables existing BTC wallets to control smart accounts on Layer-2s.
